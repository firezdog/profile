      <p>I have been a poet, classicist, philosopher, and teacher. I live in and for my thoughts and imagination. What most impresses me about the world is the amazing scope and complexity of the things people have built; my ambition is to work with you to add a new stone to that edifice.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of 2018, I studied full-stack development at Coding Dojo in 3 stacks: Python (Django, mySQL), MEAN, and C#/.NET. Since then I have been working to apply and expand upon the skills I acquired there. My working philosophy is minimalism: break problems into their simplest components and then build out. Look for the elements of all things.</p>
      <p>To those I work with I offer intellectual versatility and critical insight; from them I hope to gain a deeper and broader professional background. If we pool our strengths, we can make the world.</p>

<!--<p>My first introduction to the computer was games; my first introduction to programming was DOS, which my dad had to tinker with interminably before I could get a chance to play them. In high school, I learned Java and C in the hopes of programming my own games -- but the complexity of the task was daunting, and I turned to writing as as a more accessible method of developing my fantasies.</p>
<p>Writing introduced me to the life of the mind. My role-models became authors such as James Joyce, Dante, Rimbaud, Virgil -- and then Kant. My interests expanded beyond literature: in graduate school I studied philosophy and tried to pick up some of the basics of math, physics, and biology. I wanted to understand how things worked, how to analyze and solve difficult problems: I wanted to learn what people with big ideas had to say, and I wanted to be able to own those ideas.</p>
<p>I've always been driven by my interests and am willing to sacrifice everything to pursue them. When, after five years of graduate school, I became obsessed with Chinese and decided to leave my studies and go to China. I spent five years there learning the language and culture, meanwhile teaching English to support myself. At the end of that time I was conversationally fluent and could read and write (I even taught myself to write some calligraphy), but I wasn't sure teaching was my passion. I decided it was time to go back to the US and find a career.</p>
<p>Since my return, I have worked in law, translation, and data-entry, but I've found these fields are either too routine or too inaccessible to satisfy my need for intellectual engagement. A family friend suggested that, given my analytical bent and my facility with computers, programming might be a good area to explore. I started to learn Python; the journey so far has been deep and rewarding.</p>
<p>I am now working as hard as I can to improve my knowledge and build projects. I enrolled at Coding Dojo, where I've been learning front and back-end web development in Python, C#, and MEAN. After several months of intensive study, I am ready to take my first steps into the field.</p> -->
