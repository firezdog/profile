    <h2 class="text-center">Why I Program</h2>
    <p>My first introduction to the computer was games; my first introduction to programming was DOS, which my dad had to tinker with interminably before I could get a chance to play them. In high school, I learned Java and C in the hopes of programming my own games -- but the complexity of the task was daunting, and I turned to writing as as a more accessible method of developing my fantasies.</p>
    <p>Writing introduced me to the life of the mind. My role-models became authors such   as James Joyce, Dante, Rimbaud, Virgil -- and then Kant. My interests expanded beyond literature: in graduate school I studied philosophy and tried to pick up some of the basics of math, physics, and biology. I wanted to understand how things worked, how to analyze and solve difficult problems: I wanted to learn what people with big ideas had to say, and I wanted to be able to own those ideas.</p>
    <p>I've always been driven by my interests and am willing to sacrifice everything to pursue them. That's why when, after five years of graduate school, I became obsessed with Chinese, I decided to leave my studies and go to China. I spent five years there learning the language and culture, meanwhile teaching English to support myself. At the end of that time I was conversationally fluent and could read and write (I even taught myself to write some calligraphy), but I wasn't sure teaching was my passion. I decided it was time to go back to the US and embark on a career.</p>
    <p>Since my return, I have worked in law, translation, and data-entry, but I've found these fields are either too routine or too inaccessible to satisfy my need for intellectual engagement. A family friend suggested that, given my analytical bent and my facility with computers, programming might be a good area to explore. I started to learn Python; the journey since then has been deep and rewarding.</p>
    <p>I am now working as hard as I can to improve my knowledge and build projects. In February of 2018, I enrolled at Coding Dojo, where I've been learning front and back-end web development in Python, C#, and MEAN. After several months of intensive study, I am ready to take my first steps into the field.</p>
